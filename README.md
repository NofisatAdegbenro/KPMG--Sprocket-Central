## Intrduction
I was an intern at KPMG Australia (Data Analytics Virtual Internship via Forage) for a period of 6 Months where I had the opportunity to work as a Data Analyst for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

## Background Information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space [you can read more here](https://kpmg.com/au/en/home/services/advisory/management-consulting/digital/data-analytics-modelling.html). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months


## Problem Statement
Provide data-driven Insights with existing sales, demography, and customers data to aid new marketing You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.


## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
The first task in this exercise is to “draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate this issues referring to the Data Quality Framework Table as a guide”. With this in mind, I start the preliminary data exploration using Microsoft Excel to identify ways of improving the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

Below is the Data Quality Framework Table That Guided me in my assessment:

## Task 2: Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.
For the second task, i created a powerpoint presentation to outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client agreed to a 3-week scope with the following 3 phases as follows — Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

It is important to state that Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions), there was need to explore and recommend 1000 new customers who would be targeted to drive the most value for the company. 

The key objectives of the analysis is to identify high value customers to target from the new customer list based on analysis of the old customers demographics and attributes.

The powerpoint slides that i created containing my Data exploration, Model development, and Interpretation processes can be found in this repository.

## Task 3: Data Insight, Visualization and Presentation
This third task requires using data visualization tools to develop a dashboard that can be presented to the client. It is important to make sure the dashboard shows data points that answer the key objective questions of the business. The dashboard was created to provide insights and answer the business pressing questions for the marketing team. see the dashboard below;
